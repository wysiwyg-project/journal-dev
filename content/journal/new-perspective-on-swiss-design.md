“Swiss Graphic Design Histories” offers a redefinition of Switzerland’s graphic design landscape. Based on the extensive research done in line with the project’s multiple and inclusive approaches, the publication reaches beyond the usual canon and the well-known epicentres with the Germanophone fathers of what has become famous as the Swiss Style.

Our research activities have not ended with the present publication. Further individual findings from the project will be discussed and published independently by our doctoral students as part of their theses. We hope they will continue the academic discourse in graphic design history in Switzerland, conduct further research, and ultimately assume positions from which they might pursue additional topics in this vein.
